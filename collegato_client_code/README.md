# Collegato (Client) â€” README.md:

This project was created by Pranav Joshi and Yajat Mittal for CNLC 2024.  You need written permission from both of us if you wish to use Collegato as an application or Collegato's code.  This directory is the client portion of the project.

## Description:

This project is the front-end of the Collegato app.  It is meant to be easily customizable and user friendly.  Whenever a field isn't valid, there is an icon that indicates if it's valid or not.  If the user still attempts to submit the fields, a helpful notification card slides out to explain what is invalid.

## Notes:

The server must be executed first before running the client.

---
## Plans for future development:

This client was made using python due to its huge support and ease of coding.  In version 3 of this project, we would like to expand on this project by:
- Implementing Cython which will cause the client to have the same performance as C.
- Adding audio sound effects where possible (like a "ding" for apply on Filter button).
- Porting the client to MacOS and Linux (wasn't possible as of February 7th, 2023 due to time constraints)
